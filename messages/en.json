	"faq_prefix": "Frequently asked questions",
	"faq_title": "Got a question? Seekode is here!",
	"faq_q1_title": "Is this training suitable for complete beginners?",
	"faq_q1_title_vibe": "Can I vibe code without knowing how to code?",
	"faq_q1_text": "Yes, absolutely. The training is designed to adapt to your level, whether you're starting from scratch or already have some basics.<br>No need to have attended an IT school or bootcamp before. We start where you are and move at your pace. The only prerequisite is motivation.",
	"faq_q1_text_vibe": "Yes, and that's exactly why this training exists. AI works best when you know how to guide it — and that can be learned.<br><br>We give you the foundations that make the difference between a vibe coder stuck at 80% of their project and one who delivers complete apps. No need to have coded before. We start from zero, but we teach you what matters: essential tools, project structure, and the reflexes to make AI actually work for you.",
	"faq_q2_title": "How long does the training take?",
	"faq_q2_title_vibe": "How long before I can create my apps?",
	"faq_q2_text": "It depends on you. It's a custom training, so there's no fixed duration. Some progress quickly because they have free time, others take several months alongside their job.<br>What matters is consistency. On average, expect a few months to gain real autonomy, but you'll progress from the very first weeks.",
	"faq_q2_text_vibe": "Less time than a traditional dev training. You're not learning to become a developer — you're learning to pilot AI effectively.<br><br>In a few weeks, you can be operational and launch your first real projects. The pace depends on you, but the goal is clear: make you autonomous quickly, not have you spend months on theory.",
	"faq_q3_title": "Why pay when there are free resources everywhere?",
	"faq_q3_title_vibe": "Why pay when AI tools are free?",
	"faq_q3_text": "Free resources have three real problems.<br>1. First, when you're stuck, you're alone — some people spend days on a bug with no one to help them.<br>2. Second, no one tells you what's truly essential: many self-taught developers discover Git years too late.<br>3. Finally, tutorials make you dependent: you learn to follow instructions, not to code by yourself.<br><br>With Seelearn, you have an instructor available to unblock you, a program designed custom from the first call, and exercises targeted at your weaknesses to become truly autonomous.",
	"faq_q3_text_vibe": "The tools are free, but mistakes are expensive.<br><br>Without method, here's what happens: your project moves fast, then collapses at 80%. The code becomes unmaintainable. You introduce security flaws without knowing it. You waste hours asking AI for the impossible.<br><br>With Seelearn, you learn to avoid these pitfalls. We give you the structure, tools, and reflexes so your projects hold up — not just flimsy prototypes.",
	"faq_q4_title": "How can I be sure I'll finish?",
	"faq_q4_text": "You're not left on your own with a program. You have a dedicated instructor who follows your progress, has regular check-ins with you, and gives you concrete feedback on your strengths and areas for improvement. They're there to push you when things slow down.<br><br>No useless or temporary exercises: every project is designed to facilitate your professional integration. From the start, you build a portfolio that you feed throughout the training. At the end, you have concrete achievements to show in interviews, with visible progression.",
	"faq_q5_title": "Will I be supported or left on my own?",
	"faq_q5_text": "Quite the opposite. You have a dedicated instructor who follows your progress from start to finish. They have regular check-ins with you, answer your questions, and help you as soon as you're stuck. You're never alone facing a problem.<br><br>On top of that, you have access to an active community, livestreams to exchange in real time, and video content to go deeper. But the heart of the support is this direct relationship with your instructor.",
	"faq_q6_title": "Won't AI replace developers?",
	"faq_q6_title_vibe": "Can I really create real apps with AI?",
	"faq_q6_text": "Maybe. So what? There are plenty of reasons why AI will never replace a developer, and I'd be happy to discuss them with you. But honestly... it doesn't matter.<br><br>Let's imagine I'm wrong and AI really does replace us. You'll still need someone who knows how to code to verify that the AI did its job right — without security flaws or performance issues. Kind of like a site manager who supervises the workers.<br><br>Bottom line: even if it happens, we remain essential. And personally, getting paid to watch an AI work for me? I'm in.<br><br>Bonus: we also train you extensively on AI, so even if it happens, you'll be ready.",
	"faq_q6_text_vibe": "Yes, but not just any way.<br><br>Without the right foundations, you'll make prototypes that impress in demos but collapse in production. The code will be fragile, hard to evolve, potentially full of security flaws.<br><br>With the right method, you create solid, maintainable, and secure apps. That's exactly what we teach you: not just to generate code, but to build projects that last.",
	"faq_q7_title": "Can I find a job after this training?",
	"faq_q7_title_vibe": "Can I launch my own project?",
	"faq_q7_text": "Absolutely. Seelearn isn't just custom on the technical side — we define your goals together (employment, freelance, project creation) and support you to achieve them.<br><br>For example, if you're aiming for employment: every project will be visible online and added to your portfolio, we help you create content for social media, and community exercises on GitHub allow you to display regular activity.<br><br>Result: you show up to interviews with online projects, visible presence, and proof of constant activity. Trust me, less than 5% of devs make this effort — you'll already be ahead of the pack.",
	"faq_q7_text_vibe": "That's exactly the goal. We don't train you to find a dev job — we train you to make your ideas real.<br><br>Side project, MVP, startup, internal tool... You leave with a working project, not just theoretical skills. And most importantly, you know how to evolve it, maintain it, and launch others.<br><br>You have the idea, we give you the means to make it happen.",
	"faq_q8_title": "Is the training certified?",
	"faq_q8_text": "No, and that's by design. A degree requires a rigid program — incompatible with the custom approach we offer.<br><br>These are two different approaches: a certified training gives you academic proof. We build technical proof with you: online projects, GitHub activity, visible presence.<br><br>In the market, some companies rely solely on degrees. Others only look at what you can actually do. It's up to you to choose the approach that matches your goals.<br><br>What's certain: academic proof without technical proof rarely convinces — the opposite isn't true. And if you're aiming for freelance or creating your own project, the degree becomes irrelevant: you won't reject yourself in an interview.",
	"faq_q9_title": "What exactly does 'custom' mean?",
	"faq_q9_text": "Custom means we adapt the path to you — not the other way around.<br><br>Concretely: we evaluate your level, your goals, and together we build the most efficient path. You don't waste time on what you already know, and you go deeper where you really need to.<br><br>It's the opposite of a fixed program where everyone follows the same course, at the same pace, with the same exercises. Here, every hour counts — and it's designed to make you progress, you.",
